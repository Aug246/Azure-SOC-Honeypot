# Azure-SOC-Honeypot
## Introduction

This project demonstrates the deployment of a honeypot-based Security Operations Center (SOC) in Microsoft Azure to capture, analyze, and visualize real-world cyberattacks. By intentionally exposing a vulnerable virtual machine (VM) to the internet, I collected logs of malicious activity, integrated them into Microsoft Sentinel, and built dashboards to monitor and understand attacker behavior.

The project highlights my ability to:
- Design and configure cloud-based security environments.
- Collect, analyze, and correlate security event data.
- Use visualization tools to track adversary behavior in real time.
